## How to Get Your Steam API Key, User ID, and Set Your Profile to Public

### 1. Get Your Steam API Key

1. **Log into Steam**: Open your web browser and go to the [Steam website](https://store.steampowered.com/). Log in with your Steam account.
   
2. **Go to the Steam API Key Page**: Navigate to the [Steam Web API Key registration page](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).

3. **Generate Your API Key**:
   - If you don't already have an API key, you'll see a form asking for a domain name. You can enter any domain name (even a placeholder like "localhost").
   - Agree to the terms, and click on **"Register"**.
   - Your API key will be generated and displayed on the page.

### 2. Find Your Steam User ID

Your Steam user ID is a unique identifier for your account. You can find it in several ways:

- **From Your Profile URL**:
  1. Go to your Steam profile by clicking on your username in the upper right corner and selecting **"Profile"**.
  2. Look at the URL in your browser's address bar. It will look something like this: `https://steamcommunity.com/id/YourCustomID/` or `https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/12345678901234567/`.
  3. If your URL is in the format `/profiles/12345678901234567/`, then `12345678901234567` is your Steam user ID.
  4. If your URL is in the format `/id/YourCustomID/`, you'll need to look it up by using third-party services like [SteamID.io](https://steamid.io/) or converting it by logging into Steam and checking under your account details.

### 3. Make Sure Your Profile and Online Status Are Public

To make sure your Steam profile and online status are public, follow these steps:

1. **Open Steam and Go to Your Profile**:
   - Open the Steam client or use your web browser to navigate to the [Steam website](https://store.steampowered.com/).
   - Click on your username in the upper right corner and select **"Profile"**.

2. **Edit Profile Settings**:
   - On your profile page, click the **"Edit Profile"** button.

3. **Set Your Privacy Settings**:
   - Go to the **"Privacy Settings"** tab.
   - Set **"My Profile"** to **"Public"**.
   - Set **"Game Details"** to **"Public"** if you want others to see your game list and playtime.
   - Set **"Friends List"** and **"Inventory"** to **"Public"** if you want these visible to everyone.
   - Set **"Profile Status"** to **"Online"** if you want to be visible as online to others.

4. **Save Changes**: Click the **"Save Changes"** button to apply the new privacy settings.
